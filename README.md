# VARpedia-JavaFX-Group42
This project is a collaboration between JChamberlain28 and gsin387. It is a continuation of "SE206A3" which is in turn a continuation of "Wiki-Speak-JavaFX-GUI".

VARpedia is a JavaFX program that aids the creation of video about a specified Wikipedia term.
The video contains the term name, a slideshow of images and computer generated audio speaking about it (using Festival).
This program was created for the target audience of elderly users. It features a dark, high contrast theme with large elements. 
It also features a reminder system, encouraging the user to review their creation videos regularly.


For guidance on using the features of this program, please consult the VARpedia user manual. To use the program, you must supply your own flickr API keys in the "flickr-api-keys.txt" file. These have not been included for security reasons.


Dependancies (required packages):
